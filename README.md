Running Instrution

- Install all requirements from requirement.txt (pip install -r requirement.txt)
- Create a .env file in the folder to add DB_PASSWORD='Your password', and adjust user in db_config if needed
- Run main.py using Python3 (python main.py)
- Enter 1 for fr1, 2 for fr2, ...etc

Known bugs and/or deficiencies
- Encountered a big bug when developing FR2, where the query could not filter and display the 5 possibilites we wanted correctly, but was later fixed after adjusting and tweaking the logic.

Additional Notes
- We work together and develop the program on 1 machine so the log file only display 1 user
